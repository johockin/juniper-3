# ðŸŽ¸ CREATIVE DIRECTIONS - 5 STYLING RIFFS

## ðŸŽ¯ Direction 1: "TYPOGRAPHIC MAXIMALISM"
*Inspired by: Verve's massive type statements, Hello Robo's bold headlines*

### **Visual Concept**
- **Hero type at 12-20vw**: "TORONTO'S PREMIER VIDEO PRODUCTION" as massive, screen-filling statement
- **Layered typography**: Different sizes creating visual rhythm
- **Mixed weights**: Ultra-bold mixed with hair-thin details
- **Color**: Stark black/white with one accent (deep red or electric blue)

### **Key Changes**
- Replace hero video with massive typographic statement
- Case studies with huge project names, tiny descriptions
- "SUBWAY" in 8vw, "Valentine's campaign" in 0.8rem
- Testimonials as giant quotes with tiny attribution

### **Performance Impact**: Minimal - just CSS typography changes
