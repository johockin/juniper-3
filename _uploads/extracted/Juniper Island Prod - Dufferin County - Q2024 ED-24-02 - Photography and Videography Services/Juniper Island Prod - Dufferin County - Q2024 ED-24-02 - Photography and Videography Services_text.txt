[7] We started working with one of our longest standing clients, the Canadian Media Producers Association 8 years ago, when we created a brand sizzle video for them, which played a crucial role in their branding strategy.

[30] We partnered with Subway Canada and agency Dentsu Creative on a Valentine's Day campaign to create real-life romantic connections in a Subway restaurant. This project required rapid execution, filming, and post-production.

[31] Problem: Dentsu Creative approached us with a last-minute concept: staging blind dates in a Subway to spark genuine connections. We had 7 days for planning and shooting, and 5 days for post-production. The campaign needed to look cinematic yet candid, within the constraints of a small, operational Subway restaurant.

[32] Solution: We used compact Sony cameras and GoPros to capture multiple angles. We chose a table behind a pillar for privacy and optimal branding visibility, leveraging natural light. Under the creative direction of Johnny Hockin, we created an environment fostering authentic interactions, using open-ended questions to prompt natural dialogue.

[33] Execution: We filmed 12 dates over six hours and focused on editing for social media impact: intrigue, a strong opening, and fast cuts. We balanced the agency's need for meaningful communication with Subway's preference for a fun, punchy presentation.

[34] Result: We delivered two 15-second teasers and a 1:15 video. Within a day, the teasers reached 500,000 views on TikTok and Instagram, totaling 10 million views and 8 million engagements by week's end. The audience responded enthusiastically, engaging with the content like a reality dating show. The campaign's success led to further collaborations with Dentsu.

[35] 5. Muskoka Roastery Coffee Company

[36] Muskoka Roastery Coffee Company is an Ontario-based coffee roastery in Huntsville. They hired us to create premium, short form documentaries for their YouTube channel in an effort to show their brand’s love of (and place in) the Canadian wilderness. For the first film, our budget was $60K CAD to create a 15-minute film and related social assets, with a potential shooting schedule of 7-14 days. After a careful research process, we settled on telling the story of the Algonquin Wolf. Its stillness, nobility, unique geographical relevance to the Roastery, as well as the intriguing scientific and Indigenous characters made it an interesting subject. We traveled around the province and collaborated with Magnetawan First Nation to tell the story.

[37] The film

[38] was well received, earning more than 56K organic views.

[39] The client was exceptionally happy and greenlit a second film about a 24-hour canoe race that takes place all day and night in Huntsville, with a fraction of the racers even finishing the race.. The province’s vibrant marathon canoe racing community cooperated with us and championed our film and helped us earn more than 250,000 views on the project, and we were invited to screen at the Paddling film festival.

[41] 6. Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre

[42] The Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre recently hired us to create a 90-second branded content video surrounding their sustainability initiative during the 2024 Olympic Swim Trials. The project was a collaboration between TPASC, Intuitive AI (a tech company revolutionising recycling sorting with AI operated screens that indicate to consumers how to sort their waste) and Friendlier (an Ontario-based tech firm that has invented

[43] reusable

[44] takeaway containers for restaurants). The budget was tight on this project but we were keen to work on a project that aligned with our sustainability values and it was a great opportunity to collaborate with 3 local businesses doing important work for the environment. We took care of all things preproduction, including writing the script all the way to the final touches of audio and colour-correcting. All three clients were very happy with the project and we’ve already signed on to do 2 more campaigns with Friendlier.
