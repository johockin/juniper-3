## üèÜ THIS FILE IS GOLD - PRESERVE AT ALL COSTS

**THIS FILE IS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** - It contains the complete institutional knowledge for this project.

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL PRESERVATION RULE**: If you EVER revert to a previous version of the site via git or any other method, YOU MUST PRESERVE THIS FILE. Copy it before reverting, then restore it after. This file contains knowledge that transcends any single version of the code.

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository. It serves as:
- **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** for all development work
- **Complete action log** of everything we've done
- **Dream features wishlist** for future development
- **Best practices guide** that works vs. what doesn't
- **Project ethos** and philosophy preservation
- **Handoff documentation** for new Claude instances

## üîÑ MANDATORY LOGGING PROTOCOL

**EVERY ACTION MUST BE LOGGED** - Assume you might be pulled away from this project at any moment, and another Claude instance needs to seamlessly continue.

### How to Log Actions:
1. **Before doing anything**: Update the action log below
2. **After completing work**: Document results, learnings, and next steps
3. **If something fails**: Document what didn't work and why
4. **If something works great**: Document it in best practices

## üìñ HOW TO USE THIS SPEC - USER EXPECTATIONS

**THE USER EXPECTS YOU TO:**

### üö® Critical Rules
- **NEVER skip documentation** - even small changes must be logged
- **ALWAYS preserve this file** - it's more important than any code
- **QUESTION everything** - if something isn't documented, ask why
- **ASSUME discontinuity** - every session might be your last
- **ASK PERMISSION** before making changes - user might just be venting, not requesting work
- **PRESERVE uploads** - keep all uploaded materials as reference brain

### üé≠ Your Role
You are the "guy from Memento" - this file is your external memory. Without it, you know nothing about:
- What we've tried before
- What works vs what doesn't
- Why decisions were made
- Where we're headed
- What the user values

**THE USER WILL NOT REPEAT THEMSELVES** - Everything you need to know is in this file.

## üìö FUTURE-PROOF DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS (CRITICAL)

**ALL CHANGES MUST BE COMPREHENSIVELY DOCUMENTED** - This ensures continuity across Claude instances and team members.

### Documentation Requirements
1. **Update CLAUDE.md** for every significant change

3. **Record configuration changes** with rationale
4. **Maintain file structure** documentation
5. **Update dependency explanations** when packages change
6. **Document performance impacts** of any modifications

### Documentation Philosophy
- **Assume future Claude instances** know nothing about previous decisions
- **Explain the 'why'** behind every architectural choice
- **Provide clear examples** for common tasks
- **Keep documentation current** - outdated docs are worse than no docs
- **Use clear headings** and structure for easy navigation

### What Must Be Documented

- **Include code examples** where relevant
- **Explain complex concepts** in simple terms
- **Cross-reference related sections** for context
- **Mark critical sections** with emphasis

## MAINTENANCE RULES

1. **Never add external fonts** - system fonts only
2. **Question every dependency** - bundle size impact analysis required
3. **Optimize every asset** - images, videos, files must be compressed
4. **Test performance** - run Lighthouse on every change
5. **Maintain SEO** - verify meta tags and structured data directly in index.html head section
6. **Keep it simple** - complexity is the enemy of performance
7. **Document everything** - update CLAUDE.md for ALL changes
8. **Centralize configuration** - use config files, not hardcoded values

### 2025-01-12 (Previous)
- **Claude Instance**: Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) - continuing session
- **Context**: Continuation of creative direction tweaks before presenting to Nina
- **Action**: User requested left-alignment of stats/buttons in Direction 7 video section
- **Implementation**: Changed `.hero-video-content` from `align-items: center` to `align-items: flex-start` and added `padding-left: 4rem`
- **Result**: Stats and buttons now left-aligned in video section, matching original Direction 3 aesthetic
- **Action**: User requested video be more prominent - "here, watch the video" feeling
- **Video Enhancements**: 
  - Reduced overlay opacity from 12% to 5% (much more video visible)
  - Added white border frame around video section (3px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.8))
  - Increased video height from 60vh to 70vh (larger, more prominent)
  - Added "‚ñ∂ Watch Our Work" label in top-right of video area
  - Added hover effects - video scales on hover, label lifts up
  - Added margin, border radius, and box shadow for framed appearance
- **Result**: Video now feels like featured content rather than background footage
- **Action**: User requested navigation with site link
- **Navigation Implementation**:
  - Fixed navigation in top-right corner with glass morphism effect
  - "Main Site" button with dark background to stand out
  - Added Work, About, Contact links with hover states
  - Proper z-index layering above video
- **Result**: Clean navigation provides easy access back to main site
- **CRITICAL ERROR**: User discovered Direction 7 missing from creative jam navigation page
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Failed to read entire CLAUDE.md spec before acting - violated mandatory protocol
- **USER FEEDBACK**: "Are you reading the spec? I feel like you're not reading the spec"
- **CORRECTIVE ACTION**: Read complete CLAUDE.md spec file from top to bottom
- **LESSON LEARNED**: Must ALWAYS read entire spec first before any actions
- **Action**: Added Direction 7 to creative jam NAVIGATION.html
- **Implementation**: Added Direction 7 card with description "Based on Direction 3 with Verve-style white bar at top containing headline/paragraph, video section below with stats/buttons/brands"
- **Visual**: Created `.preview-7` CSS with white top section and gray bottom to represent layout concept
- **Result**: Direction 7 now accessible from main creative jam navigation
- **Action**: User requested video improvements - remove navbar, make edge-to-edge, remove "watch our work" button
- **Implementation**: Removed all navigation CSS/HTML, removed video border/margin/border-radius for edge-to-edge effect, removed video label
- **Result**: Clean video section spanning full width without framing or distracting elements
- **Action**: User requested headline/paragraph spacing adjustments for elegant video transition
- **Spacing Iterations**: Multiple adjustments to bottom padding of white bar section (4rem ‚Üí 0 ‚Üí 1.5rem ‚Üí 3rem)
- **Result**: Found optimal 3rem spacing creating elegant transition from white bar to video
- **Action**: User requested headline closer to left edge, paragraph closer to right edge
- **Layout Fixes**: Reduced white bar padding to 1.5rem all around, added `margin-left: auto` to paragraph container
- **Result**: Headline and paragraph properly positioned at page edges with appropriate spacing
- **Action**: User requested Juniper Island logo in vertical letterhead treatment
- **Challenge**: Multiple positioning attempts with overlap and sizing issues
- **Container Discovery**: Logo initially positioned within padded `.hero-bar` causing alignment with headline
- **Solution**: Used negative left positioning (`left: -1.7rem`) to escape container padding constraints
- **Final Logo Implementation**:
  - Position: `absolute` within `.hero-bar`
  - Size: 24px height (optimal for vertical readability)
  - Location: `top: 24%`, `left: -1.7rem` (perfectly positioned in left margin)
  - Transform: `translateY(-50%) rotate(-90deg)` for proper vertical orientation
  - Opacity: 0.4 for subtle letterhead aesthetic with 0.8 hover state
- **Result**: Perfect letterhead-style vertical logo in left margin of white bar section
- **Action**: User requested refined spacing adjustments for final polish
- **White Bar Spacing Refinements**:
  - Applied spacing formula twice: increase top padding 15%, decrease bottom padding 10%
  - First iteration: 4rem ‚Üí 4.6rem top, 3rem ‚Üí 2.7rem bottom
  - Second iteration: 4.6rem ‚Üí 5.29rem top, 2.7rem ‚Üí 2.43rem bottom
  - Final iteration: 5.29rem ‚Üí 6.08rem top, 2.43rem ‚Üí 2.19rem bottom
- **Logo Fine-Tuning**:
  - Repositioned: `left: -1.7rem` ‚Üí `left: -1.2rem` ‚Üí `left: -0.9rem` (moved progressively right)
  - Adjusted vertically: `top: 24%` ‚Üí `top: 27%` (moved down for better positioning)
  - Size optimization: 24px ‚Üí 26.4px height (10% increase for better visibility)
- **Final Specifications**:
  - White bar padding: `6.08rem 1.5rem 2.19rem 1.5rem` (perfect balance)
  - Logo position: `top: 27%, left: -0.9rem, height: 26.4px`
  - Logo styling: 40% opacity with 80% hover, rotated -90deg for vertical letterhead effect
- **Result**: Polished Direction 7 with perfect spacing hierarchy and professional logo placement
- **Action**: User requested removal of floating stats and CTA buttons to clean up video experience
- **Problem Solved**: Stats and CTAs were floating center-left over video, disrupting the clean edge-to-edge aesthetic
- **Solution Process**:
  - Initially moved CTAs to white bar below paragraph (good flow but made paragraph too tall)
  - Tried positioning CTAs over video in same visual area (better balance)
  - Final decision: Remove all CTAs entirely (navigation will handle this later)
- **Result**: Clean video section with no floating elements, perfect for video focus
- **Action**: User requested redesign of "Trusted by" overlay - too prominent and distracting from video
- **Old Design Problems**: Large overlay with 4rem padding, 84px logos, complex grid taking up significant video space
- **New Low-Profile Design**:
  - Moved to belt below video instead of overlay on video
  - Dark background (#1a1a1a) - doesn't compete with video content
  - Compact 2rem padding vs original 4rem
  - Horizontal layout: "Trusted by" + logos on left, testimonial on right
  - Logo size: 72px height (tripled from initial 24px for proper visibility)
  - Subtle typography with muted colors
- **Glass Edge Experiment**: Tried subtle glass effect at video/belt boundary but determined it was superfluous
- **Final Polish**: Removed 1px border artifact at video bottom with `margin-top: -1px` on trusted belt
- **Final Direction 7 Specifications**:
  - White bar: `padding: 6.08rem 1.5rem 2.19rem 1.5rem` (perfect hierarchy)
  - Logo: `top: 27%, left: -0.9rem, height: 26.4px` (vertical letterhead positioning)
  - Video: Edge-to-edge with 5% white overlay for subtle content visibility

### 2025-01-15 (Later) - Direction 2 Implementation Feedback

### 2025-01-15 (Critical CSS Fix Session)
- **Claude Instance**: Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) - continued session
- **Context**: Continuing Direction 2 implementation with critical CSS override issue
- **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: CSS styles not applying despite correct inline code
- **Root Cause**: Tailwind config was importing DM Sans font, overriding system font approach
- **Problem**: `tailwind.config.js` had `fontFamily: { sans: ['DM Sans', 'sans-serif'] }`
- **Evidence**: Compiled CSS showed `font-family:DM Sans,sans-serif` in HTML tag
- **User Report**: Browser inspector showed `font-size: 13px` with strikethrough on inline styles
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Updated Tailwind config to use system fonts only
- **New Config**: `fontFamily: { sans: ['system-ui', '-apple-system', 'BlinkMacSystemFont', 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto', 'Oxygen', 'Ubuntu', 'Cantarell', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', 'sans-serif'] }`
- **Build Process**: Rebuilt site to regenerate CSS without DM Sans
- **Verification**: Compiled CSS now shows proper system font stack
- **Deployment**: Committed and pushed fix to remote repository for Netlify auto-deployment
- **Result**: Should resolve CSS override issue where inline styles were being ignored
- **Performance Alignment**: Maintains CLAUDE.md performance standards with zero external font loading
- **Status**: Critical fix deployed, awaiting user QA confirmation on Netlify
- **Claude Instance**: Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) - continuing session
- **Context**: User provided detailed QA feedback comparing current implementation to original Direction 2 jam version
- **User Feedback Summary**: Implementation successful but several elements need refinement to match jam version quality
- **Specific Issues Identified**:
  - **Stats section**: Numbers feel larger, text underneath smaller than jam version - less "put together"
  - **Testimonial section**: Should be tighter, name not perfectly left-justified with quote like jam version
  - **Work section**: Jam had stronger opening sentence vs current "bloated headlines", missing placeholder images create disappointment
  - **Services section**: "Why Story-Driven..." question was stronger, text sizes should be larger like jam version  
  - **About section**: Should match jam version more closely, even if removing content - prefer just headlines
  - **Contact form**: Too subtle, needs more grey distinction between form parts and labels
  - **Navigation approach**: Don't want navbar - prefer floating elements like Direction 6, vertical along edges, persistent logo
- **Positive feedback**: Testimonials section actually better than jam version
- **Next action**: Systematic refinement to match jam version quality while preserving performance

---

## ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS - WHAT DOESN'T WORK

### Performance Killers
- **External fonts**: Even Google Fonts add 200-500ms delay
- **Unused dependencies**: Each package adds to bundle size
- **Unoptimized images**: Can kill Core Web Vitals scores
- **Inline styles**: Harder to maintain and can block rendering
- **External fonts in Tailwind config**: DM Sans or other web fonts in Tailwind config override system fonts and cause CSS specificity issues

### SEO Killers
- **Hardcoded meta tags**: Leads to inconsistency and maintenance hell
- **Missing structured data**: Reduces search engine understanding
- **Poor heading hierarchy**: Confuses search engines and users
- **Slow loading**: Directly impacts search rankings

### Development Killers
- **Scattered configuration**: Hard to maintain and update
- **Poor documentation**: Wastes time for future developers
- **Complex abstractions**: Harder to debug and maintain
- **Inconsistent patterns**: Creates confusion and bugs
- **Making up features**: Don't assume what user wants - ask and validate
- **Sea of text**: Too much text without visual breaks creates poor UX
- **Generic tech aesthetics**: Broad appeal approaches that lack premium positioning
- **Rave crew design**: Overly technical or youth-focused design that doesn't target mature clients
- **Centered formatting**: Overly centered layouts that lack editorial sophistication
- **Thick/heavy fonts**: Heavy typography that lacks the refined feel of premium brands
- **Broad accessibility**: Trying to appeal to everyone instead of focusing on premium positioning
