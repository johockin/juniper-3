## üéØ CENTRALIZED SEO MANAGEMENT (CRITICAL)

**ALL SEO SETTINGS ARE MANAGED FROM A SINGLE FILE: `config/seo.ts`**

### SEO Configuration System
- **Single source of truth** for all SEO settings
- **Centralized config file** prevents SEO fragmentation
- **Future-proof structure** that survives code iterations
- **Easy maintenance** by any Claude instance or developer

### SEO File Structure
```
config/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ seo.ts          # ALL SEO settings live here
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ siteConfig      # Main configuration object
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ business info   # Contact details, location
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ keywords        # SEO keywords array
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ social media    # Open Graph, Twitter cards
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ structured data # JSON-LD schema
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ helper functions # Utility functions
```

### How to Update SEO Settings
1. **ONLY edit `config/seo.ts`** - Never hardcode SEO values in components
2. **Use the helper functions** provided in the config file
3. **Test changes** by running `npm run build` after SEO updates
4. **Verify structured data** using Google's Rich Results Test

### SEO Implementation Details
- **Complete metadata** automatically generated from config
- **Structured data (JSON-LD)** for local business schema
- **Open Graph and Twitter Cards** centrally managed
- **XML sitemap** auto-generated at `/sitemap.xml`
- **Robots.txt** properly configured at `/robots.txt`
- **Semantic HTML** structure throughout
- **Proper heading hierarchy** (h1 -> h2 -> h3)

## üöÄ NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT (CRITICAL)

**AUTO-DEPLOYMENT**: Site auto-deploys from git pushes to Netlify. Every commit triggers a build.

### Netlify Configuration (`netlify.toml`)
- **Next.js plugin** for proper static generation
- **Performance headers** for aggressive caching (1 year for static assets)
- **Security headers** for protection (XSS, clickjacking, etc.)
- **Node 20 + NPM 10** build environment

### Netlify Forms Integration
- **Built into Netlify infrastructure** for INTENSE performance
- **No external form services** to maintain fast load times
- **Contact form** uses Netlify's native form handling
- **Pre-rendered forms** in `public/__forms.html` for discovery

### Performance Optimizations for Netlify
- **Static generation** with Next.js export
- **Aggressive caching** for images, videos, and static assets
- **No external dependencies** that would slow down their edge network
- **Optimized build process** for fast deployment

### Deployment Workflow
1. **Push to git** ‚Üí Auto-triggers Netlify build
2. **Netlify builds** with Next.js plugin 
3. **Deploy to edge network** with performance headers
4. **Forms automatically work** via Netlify infrastructure

## Styling Approach

- **System fonts** for instant loading
- **Minimal Tailwind** with performance-focused utilities
- **No external dependencies** for animations
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach
- **Clean, semantic CSS** structure

## üìö FUTURE-PROOF DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS (CRITICAL)

**ALL CHANGES MUST BE COMPREHENSIVELY DOCUMENTED** - This ensures continuity across Claude instances and team members.

### Documentation Requirements
1. **Update CLAUDE.md** for every significant change
2. **Document new features** with detailed explanations
3. **Record configuration changes** with rationale
4. **Maintain file structure** documentation
5. **Update dependency explanations** when packages change
6. **Document performance impacts** of any modifications

### Documentation Philosophy
- **Assume future Claude instances** know nothing about previous decisions
- **Explain the 'why'** behind every architectural choice
- **Provide clear examples** for common tasks
- **Keep documentation current** - outdated docs are worse than no docs
- **Use clear headings** and structure for easy navigation

### What Must Be Documented
- **Performance optimizations** and their rationale
- **SEO configuration changes** and their impact
- **New dependencies** and why they were added
- **File structure changes** and their purpose
- **Build process modifications** and their benefits
- **Configuration updates** and their effects

### Documentation Format
- **Use clear, scannable headings** with emojis for priority
- **Include code examples** where relevant
- **Explain complex concepts** in simple terms
- **Cross-reference related sections** for context
- **Mark critical sections** with emphasis

## MAINTENANCE RULES

1. **Never add external fonts** - system fonts only
2. **Question every dependency** - bundle size impact analysis required
3. **Optimize every asset** - images, videos, files must be compressed
4. **Test performance** - run Lighthouse on every change
5. **Maintain SEO** - verify meta tags and structured data using `config/seo.ts`
6. **Keep it simple** - complexity is the enemy of performance
7. **Document everything** - update CLAUDE.md for ALL changes
8. **Centralize configuration** - use config files, not hardcoded values
