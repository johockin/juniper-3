## üèÜ THIS FILE IS GOLD - PRESERVE AT ALL COSTS

**THIS FILE IS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** - It contains the complete institutional knowledge for this project.

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL PRESERVATION RULE**: If you EVER revert to a previous version of the site via git or any other method, YOU MUST PRESERVE THIS FILE. Copy it before reverting, then restore it after. This file contains knowledge that transcends any single version of the code.

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository. It serves as:
- **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** for all development work
- **Complete action log** of everything we've done
- **Dream features wishlist** for future development
- **Best practices guide** that works vs. what doesn't
- **Project ethos** and philosophy preservation
- **Handoff documentation** for new Claude instances

## üîÑ MANDATORY LOGGING PROTOCOL

**EVERY ACTION MUST BE LOGGED** - Assume you might be pulled away from this project at any moment, and another Claude instance needs to seamlessly continue.

### How to Log Actions:
1. **Before doing anything**: Update the action log below
2. **After completing work**: Document results, learnings, and next steps
3. **If something fails**: Document what didn't work and why
4. **If something works great**: Document it in best practices

## üìñ HOW TO USE THIS SPEC - USER EXPECTATIONS

**THE USER EXPECTS YOU TO:**

### üéØ Always Start Here
- **READ THIS ENTIRE FILE FIRST** - Before doing anything else
- **Update the action log** with what you're about to do
- **Check dream features** to see if current request aligns with roadmap
- **Review best practices** to ensure you're following proven patterns

### üìù Document Everything
- **Log every action** in the action log section
- **Update best practices** when you discover something that works well
- **Update anti-patterns** when you discover something that doesn't work
- **Add to dream features** if user mentions something for the future
- **Update troubleshooting** if you solve a problem

### üîÑ Continuous Updates
- **Never assume** the user remembers what we discussed before
- **Always reference** this file for context and decisions
- **Keep documentation current** - this file should always reflect reality
- **Think long-term** - every decision should consider future maintainability

### üö® Critical Rules
- **NEVER skip documentation** - even small changes must be logged
- **ALWAYS preserve this file** - it's more important than any code
- **QUESTION everything** - if something isn't documented, ask why
- **ASSUME discontinuity** - every session might be your last
- **ASK PERMISSION** before making changes - user might just be venting, not requesting work
- **PRESERVE uploads** - keep all uploaded materials as reference brain

### üé≠ Your Role
You are the "guy from Memento" - this file is your external memory. Without it, you know nothing about:
- What we've tried before
- What works vs what doesn't
- Why decisions were made
- Where we're headed
- What the user values

**THE USER WILL NOT REPEAT THEMSELVES** - Everything you need to know is in this file.

## Configuration Notes

- **Next.js config** includes aggressive caching, image optimization, and security headers
- **Tailwind config** uses minimal setup with system fonts
- **TypeScript** uses strict mode with path mapping (@/* for root imports)
- **ESLint** extends Next.js core web vitals and TypeScript rules
- **Netlify config** includes performance headers and caching rules

## Performance Optimizations

- **System fonts** for zero external font loading delay
- **Image optimization** with Next.js Image component
- **Video optimization** with proper compression and poster images
- **Critical CSS** inlined in layout
- **Aggressive caching** for static assets
- **Minimal JavaScript** bundle size

## üéØ CENTRALIZED SEO MANAGEMENT (CRITICAL)

**ALL SEO SETTINGS ARE MANAGED FROM A SINGLE FILE: `config/seo.ts`**

### SEO Configuration System
- **Single source of truth** for all SEO settings
- **Centralized config file** prevents SEO fragmentation
- **Future-proof structure** that survives code iterations
- **Easy maintenance** by any Claude instance or developer

### SEO File Structure
```
config/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ seo.ts          # ALL SEO settings live here
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ siteConfig      # Main configuration object
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ business info   # Contact details, location
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ keywords        # SEO keywords array
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ social media    # Open Graph, Twitter cards
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ structured data # JSON-LD schema
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ helper functions # Utility functions
```

### How to Update SEO Settings
1. **ONLY edit `config/seo.ts`** - Never hardcode SEO values in components
2. **Use the helper functions** provided in the config file
3. **Test changes** by running `npm run build` after SEO updates
4. **Verify structured data** using Google's Rich Results Test

### SEO Implementation Details
- **Complete metadata** automatically generated from config
- **Structured data (JSON-LD)** for local business schema
- **Open Graph and Twitter Cards** centrally managed
- **XML sitemap** auto-generated at `/sitemap.xml`
- **Robots.txt** properly configured at `/robots.txt`
- **Semantic HTML** structure throughout
- **Proper heading hierarchy** (h1 -> h2 -> h3)

## üöÄ NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT (CRITICAL)

**AUTO-DEPLOYMENT**: Site auto-deploys from git pushes to Netlify. Every commit triggers a build.

### Netlify Configuration (`netlify.toml`)
- **Next.js plugin** for proper static generation
- **Performance headers** for aggressive caching (1 year for static assets)
- **Security headers** for protection (XSS, clickjacking, etc.)
- **Node 20 + NPM 10** build environment

### Netlify Forms Integration
- **Built into Netlify infrastructure** for INTENSE performance
- **No external form services** to maintain fast load times
- **Contact form** uses Netlify's native form handling
- **Pre-rendered forms** in `public/__forms.html` for discovery

### Performance Optimizations for Netlify
- **Static generation** with Next.js export
- **Aggressive caching** for images, videos, and static assets
- **No external dependencies** that would slow down their edge network
- **Optimized build process** for fast deployment

### Deployment Workflow
1. **Push to git** ‚Üí Auto-triggers Netlify build
2. **Netlify builds** with Next.js plugin 
3. **Deploy to edge network** with performance headers
4. **Forms automatically work** via Netlify infrastructure

## Styling Approach

- **System fonts** for instant loading
- **Minimal Tailwind** with performance-focused utilities
- **No external dependencies** for animations
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach
- **Clean, semantic CSS** structure

## üìö FUTURE-PROOF DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS (CRITICAL)

**ALL CHANGES MUST BE COMPREHENSIVELY DOCUMENTED** - This ensures continuity across Claude instances and team members.

### Documentation Requirements
1. **Update CLAUDE.md** for every significant change
2. **Document new features** with detailed explanations
3. **Record configuration changes** with rationale
4. **Maintain file structure** documentation
5. **Update dependency explanations** when packages change
6. **Document performance impacts** of any modifications

### Documentation Philosophy
- **Assume future Claude instances** know nothing about previous decisions
- **Explain the 'why'** behind every architectural choice
- **Provide clear examples** for common tasks
- **Keep documentation current** - outdated docs are worse than no docs
- **Use clear headings** and structure for easy navigation

### What Must Be Documented
- **Performance optimizations** and their rationale
- **SEO configuration changes** and their impact
- **New dependencies** and why they were added
- **File structure changes** and their purpose
- **Build process modifications** and their benefits
- **Configuration updates** and their effects

### Documentation Format
- **Use clear, scannable headings** with emojis for priority
- **Include code examples** where relevant
- **Explain complex concepts** in simple terms
- **Cross-reference related sections** for context
- **Mark critical sections** with emphasis

## MAINTENANCE RULES

1. **Never add external fonts** - system fonts only
2. **Question every dependency** - bundle size impact analysis required
3. **Optimize every asset** - images, videos, files must be compressed
4. **Test performance** - run Lighthouse on every change
5. **Maintain SEO** - verify meta tags and structured data using `config/seo.ts`
6. **Keep it simple** - complexity is the enemy of performance
7. **Document everything** - update CLAUDE.md for ALL changes
8. **Centralize configuration** - use config files, not hardcoded values

## üìã ACTION LOG - COMPLETE HISTORY

**Format**: `[DATE] [CLAUDE_INSTANCE] [ACTION] - [RESULT/NOTES]`

### 2025-01-12 (Today)
- **Claude Instance**: Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) - continuing session
- **Context**: Continuation of creative direction tweaks before presenting to Nina
- **Action**: User requested left-alignment of stats/buttons in Direction 7 video section
- **Implementation**: Changed `.hero-video-content` from `align-items: center` to `align-items: flex-start` and added `padding-left: 4rem`
- **Result**: Stats and buttons now left-aligned in video section, matching original Direction 3 aesthetic
- **Action**: User requested video be more prominent - "here, watch the video" feeling
- **Video Enhancements**: 
  - Reduced overlay opacity from 12% to 5% (much more video visible)
  - Added white border frame around video section (3px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.8))
  - Increased video height from 60vh to 70vh (larger, more prominent)
  - Added "‚ñ∂ Watch Our Work" label in top-right of video area
  - Added hover effects - video scales on hover, label lifts up
  - Added margin, border radius, and box shadow for framed appearance
- **Result**: Video now feels like featured content rather than background footage
- **Action**: User requested navigation with site link
- **Navigation Implementation**:
  - Fixed navigation in top-right corner with glass morphism effect
  - "Main Site" button with dark background to stand out
  - Added Work, About, Contact links with hover states
  - Proper z-index layering above video
- **Result**: Clean navigation provides easy access back to main site
- **CRITICAL ERROR**: User discovered Direction 7 missing from creative jam navigation page
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Failed to read entire CLAUDE.md spec before acting - violated mandatory protocol
- **USER FEEDBACK**: "Are you reading the spec? I feel like you're not reading the spec"
- **CORRECTIVE ACTION**: Read complete CLAUDE.md spec file from top to bottom
- **LESSON LEARNED**: Must ALWAYS read entire spec first before any actions
- **Action**: Added Direction 7 to creative jam NAVIGATION.html
- **Implementation**: Added Direction 7 card with description "Based on Direction 3 with Verve-style white bar at top containing headline/paragraph, video section below with stats/buttons/brands"
- **Visual**: Created `.preview-7` CSS with white top section and gray bottom to represent layout concept
- **Result**: Direction 7 now accessible from main creative jam navigation
- **Action**: User requested video improvements - remove navbar, make edge-to-edge, remove "watch our work" button
- **Implementation**: Removed all navigation CSS/HTML, removed video border/margin/border-radius for edge-to-edge effect, removed video label
- **Result**: Clean video section spanning full width without framing or distracting elements
- **Action**: User requested headline/paragraph spacing adjustments for elegant video transition
- **Spacing Iterations**: Multiple adjustments to bottom padding of white bar section (4rem ‚Üí 0 ‚Üí 1.5rem ‚Üí 3rem)
- **Result**: Found optimal 3rem spacing creating elegant transition from white bar to video
- **Action**: User requested headline closer to left edge, paragraph closer to right edge
- **Layout Fixes**: Reduced white bar padding to 1.5rem all around, added `margin-left: auto` to paragraph container
- **Result**: Headline and paragraph properly positioned at page edges with appropriate spacing
- **Action**: User requested Juniper Island logo in vertical letterhead treatment
- **Challenge**: Multiple positioning attempts with overlap and sizing issues
- **Container Discovery**: Logo initially positioned within padded `.hero-bar` causing alignment with headline
- **Solution**: Used negative left positioning (`left: -1.7rem`) to escape container padding constraints
- **Final Logo Implementation**:
  - Position: `absolute` within `.hero-bar`
  - Size: 24px height (optimal for vertical readability)
  - Location: `top: 24%`, `left: -1.7rem` (perfectly positioned in left margin)
  - Transform: `translateY(-50%) rotate(-90deg)` for proper vertical orientation
  - Opacity: 0.4 for subtle letterhead aesthetic with 0.8 hover state
- **Result**: Perfect letterhead-style vertical logo in left margin of white bar section
- **Action**: User requested refined spacing adjustments for final polish
- **White Bar Spacing Refinements**:
  - Applied spacing formula twice: increase top padding 15%, decrease bottom padding 10%
  - First iteration: 4rem ‚Üí 4.6rem top, 3rem ‚Üí 2.7rem bottom
  - Second iteration: 4.6rem ‚Üí 5.29rem top, 2.7rem ‚Üí 2.43rem bottom
  - Final iteration: 5.29rem ‚Üí 6.08rem top, 2.43rem ‚Üí 2.19rem bottom
- **Logo Fine-Tuning**:
  - Repositioned: `left: -1.7rem` ‚Üí `left: -1.2rem` ‚Üí `left: -0.9rem` (moved progressively right)
  - Adjusted vertically: `top: 24%` ‚Üí `top: 27%` (moved down for better positioning)
  - Size optimization: 24px ‚Üí 26.4px height (10% increase for better visibility)
- **Final Specifications**:
  - White bar padding: `6.08rem 1.5rem 2.19rem 1.5rem` (perfect balance)
  - Logo position: `top: 27%, left: -0.9rem, height: 26.4px`
  - Logo styling: 40% opacity with 80% hover, rotated -90deg for vertical letterhead effect
- **Result**: Polished Direction 7 with perfect spacing hierarchy and professional logo placement
- **Action**: User requested removal of floating stats and CTA buttons to clean up video experience
- **Problem Solved**: Stats and CTAs were floating center-left over video, disrupting the clean edge-to-edge aesthetic
- **Solution Process**:
  - Initially moved CTAs to white bar below paragraph (good flow but made paragraph too tall)
  - Tried positioning CTAs over video in same visual area (better balance)
  - Final decision: Remove all CTAs entirely (navigation will handle this later)
- **Result**: Clean video section with no floating elements, perfect for video focus
- **Action**: User requested redesign of "Trusted by" overlay - too prominent and distracting from video
- **Old Design Problems**: Large overlay with 4rem padding, 84px logos, complex grid taking up significant video space
- **New Low-Profile Design**:
  - Moved to belt below video instead of overlay on video
  - Dark background (#1a1a1a) - doesn't compete with video content
  - Compact 2rem padding vs original 4rem
  - Horizontal layout: "Trusted by" + logos on left, testimonial on right
  - Logo size: 72px height (tripled from initial 24px for proper visibility)
  - Subtle typography with muted colors
- **Glass Edge Experiment**: Tried subtle glass effect at video/belt boundary but determined it was superfluous
- **Final Polish**: Removed 1px border artifact at video bottom with `margin-top: -1px` on trusted belt
- **Final Direction 7 Specifications**:
  - White bar: `padding: 6.08rem 1.5rem 2.19rem 1.5rem` (perfect hierarchy)
  - Logo: `top: 27%, left: -0.9rem, height: 26.4px` (vertical letterhead positioning)
  - Video: Edge-to-edge with 5% white overlay for subtle content visibility
  - Trusted belt: Low-profile dark strip with 72px logos and compact testimonial
  - No CTAs or floating elements - clean video focus
- **Status**: Direction 7 COMPLETE and ready for presentation to Nina - sophisticated Verve-inspired layout with professional letterhead logo and uninterrupted video experience

## ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS - WHAT DOESN'T WORK

### Performance Killers
- **External fonts**: Even Google Fonts add 200-500ms delay
- **Unused dependencies**: Each package adds to bundle size
- **Unoptimized images**: Can kill Core Web Vitals scores
- **Inline styles**: Harder to maintain and can block rendering

### SEO Killers
- **Hardcoded meta tags**: Leads to inconsistency and maintenance hell
- **Missing structured data**: Reduces search engine understanding
- **Poor heading hierarchy**: Confuses search engines and users
- **Slow loading**: Directly impacts search rankings

### Development Killers
- **Scattered configuration**: Hard to maintain and update
- **Poor documentation**: Wastes time for future developers
- **Complex abstractions**: Harder to debug and maintain
- **Inconsistent patterns**: Creates confusion and bugs
- **Making up features**: Don't assume what user wants - ask and validate
- **Sea of text**: Too much text without visual breaks creates poor UX
- **Generic tech aesthetics**: Broad appeal approaches that lack premium positioning
- **Rave crew design**: Overly technical or youth-focused design that doesn't target mature clients
- **Centered formatting**: Overly centered layouts that lack editorial sophistication
- **Thick/heavy fonts**: Heavy typography that lacks the refined feel of premium brands
- **Broad accessibility**: Trying to appeal to everyone instead of focusing on premium positioning
