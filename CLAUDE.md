4. **Test performance** - run Lighthouse on every change
5. **Maintain SEO** - verify meta tags and structured data directly in index.html head section
6. **Keep it simple** - complexity is the enemy of performance
7. **Document everything** - update CLAUDE.md for ALL changes
8. **Centralize configuration** - use config files, not hardcoded values

### 2025-01-12 (Previous)
- **Claude Instance**: Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) - continuing session
- **Context**: Continuation of creative direction tweaks before presenting to Nina
- **Action**: User requested left-alignment of stats/buttons in Direction 7 video section
- **Implementation**: Changed `.hero-video-content` from `align-items: center` to `align-items: flex-start` and added `padding-left: 4rem`
- **Result**: Stats and buttons now left-aligned in video section, matching original Direction 3 aesthetic
- **Action**: User requested video be more prominent - "here, watch the video" feeling
- **Video Enhancements**: 
  - Reduced overlay opacity from 12% to 5% (much more video visible)
  - Added white border frame around video section (3px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.8))
  - Increased video height from 60vh to 70vh (larger, more prominent)
  - Added "▶ Watch Our Work" label in top-right of video area
  - Added hover effects - video scales on hover, label lifts up
  - Added margin, border radius, and box shadow for framed appearance
- **Result**: Video now feels like featured content rather than background footage
- **Action**: User requested navigation with site link
- **Navigation Implementation**:
  - Fixed navigation in top-right corner with glass morphism effect
  - "Main Site" button with dark background to stand out
  - Added Work, About, Contact links with hover states
  - Proper z-index layering above video
- **Result**: Clean navigation provides easy access back to main site
- **CRITICAL ERROR**: User discovered Direction 7 missing from creative jam navigation page
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Failed to read entire CLAUDE.md spec before acting - violated mandatory protocol
- **USER FEEDBACK**: "Are you reading the spec? I feel like you're not reading the spec"
- **CORRECTIVE ACTION**: Read complete CLAUDE.md spec file from top to bottom
- **LESSON LEARNED**: Must ALWAYS read entire spec first before any actions
- **Action**: Added Direction 7 to creative jam NAVIGATION.html
- **Implementation**: Added Direction 7 card with description "Based on Direction 3 with Verve-style white bar at top containing headline/paragraph, video section below with stats/buttons/brands"
- **Visual**: Created `.preview-7` CSS with white top section and gray bottom to represent layout concept
- **Result**: Direction 7 now accessible from main creative jam navigation
- **Action**: User requested video improvements - remove navbar, make edge-to-edge, remove "watch our work" button
- **Implementation**: Removed all navigation CSS/HTML, removed video border/margin/border-radius for edge-to-edge effect, removed video label
- **Result**: Clean video section spanning full width without framing or distracting elements
- **Action**: User requested headline/paragraph spacing adjustments for elegant video transition
- **Spacing Iterations**: Multiple adjustments to bottom padding of white bar section (4rem → 0 → 1.5rem → 3rem)
- **Result**: Found optimal 3rem spacing creating elegant transition from white bar to video
- **Action**: User requested headline closer to left edge, paragraph closer to right edge
- **Layout Fixes**: Reduced white bar padding to 1.5rem all around, added `margin-left: auto` to paragraph container
- **Result**: Headline and paragraph properly positioned at page edges with appropriate spacing
- **Action**: User requested Juniper Island logo in vertical letterhead treatment
- **Challenge**: Multiple positioning attempts with overlap and sizing issues
- **Container Discovery**: Logo initially positioned within padded `.hero-bar` causing alignment with headline
- **Solution**: Used negative left positioning (`left: -1.7rem`) to escape container padding constraints
- **Final Logo Implementation**:
  - Position: `absolute` within `.hero-bar`
  - Size: 24px height (optimal for vertical readability)
  - Location: `top: 24%`, `left: -1.7rem` (perfectly positioned in left margin)
  - Transform: `translateY(-50%) rotate(-90deg)` for proper vertical orientation
  - Opacity: 0.4 for subtle letterhead aesthetic with 0.8 hover state
- **Result**: Perfect letterhead-style vertical logo in left margin of white bar section
- **Action**: User requested refined spacing adjustments for final polish
- **White Bar Spacing Refinements**:
  - Applied spacing formula twice: increase top padding 15%, decrease bottom padding 10%
  - First iteration: 4rem → 4.6rem top, 3rem → 2.7rem bottom
  - Second iteration: 4.6rem → 5.29rem top, 2.7rem → 2.43rem bottom
  - Final iteration: 5.29rem → 6.08rem top, 2.43rem → 2.19rem bottom
- **Logo Fine-Tuning**:
  - Repositioned: `left: -1.7rem` → `left: -1.2rem` → `left: -0.9rem` (moved progressively right)
  - Adjusted vertically: `top: 24%` → `top: 27%` (moved down for better positioning)
  - Size optimization: 24px → 26.4px height (10% increase for better visibility)
- **Final Specifications**:
  - White bar padding: `6.08rem 1.5rem 2.19rem 1.5rem` (perfect balance)
  - Logo position: `top: 27%, left: -0.9rem, height: 26.4px`
  - Logo styling: 40% opacity with 80% hover, rotated -90deg for vertical letterhead effect
- **Result**: Polished Direction 7 with perfect spacing hierarchy and professional logo placement
- **Action**: User requested removal of floating stats and CTA buttons to clean up video experience
- **Problem Solved**: Stats and CTAs were floating center-left over video, disrupting the clean edge-to-edge aesthetic
- **Solution Process**:
  - Initially moved CTAs to white bar below paragraph (good flow but made paragraph too tall)
  - Tried positioning CTAs over video in same visual area (better balance)
  - Final decision: Remove all CTAs entirely (navigation will handle this later)
- **Result**: Clean video section with no floating elements, perfect for video focus
- **Action**: User requested redesign of "Trusted by" overlay - too prominent and distracting from video
- **Old Design Problems**: Large overlay with 4rem padding, 84px logos, complex grid taking up significant video space
- **New Low-Profile Design**:
  - Moved to belt below video instead of overlay on video
  - Dark background (#1a1a1a) - doesn't compete with video content
  - Compact 2rem padding vs original 4rem
  - Horizontal layout: "Trusted by" + logos on left, testimonial on right
  - Logo size: 72px height (tripled from initial 24px for proper visibility)
  - Subtle typography with muted colors
- **Glass Edge Experiment**: Tried subtle glass effect at video/belt boundary but determined it was superfluous
- **Final Polish**: Removed 1px border artifact at video bottom with `margin-top: -1px` on trusted belt
- **Final Direction 7 Specifications**:
  - White bar: `padding: 6.08rem 1.5rem 2.19rem 1.5rem` (perfect hierarchy)
  - Logo: `top: 27%, left: -0.9rem, height: 26.4px` (vertical letterhead positioning)
  - Video: Edge-to-edge with 5% white overlay for subtle content visibility
  - Trusted belt: Low-profile dark strip with 72px logos and compact testimonial
  - No CTAs or floating elements - clean video focus
- **Status**: Direction 7 COMPLETE and ready for presentation to Nina - sophisticated Verve-inspired layout with professional letterhead logo and uninterrupted video experience

### 2025-01-15 (Later) - Direction 2 Implementation Feedback

### 2025-01-15 (Critical CSS Fix Session)
- **Claude Instance**: Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) - continued session
- **Context**: Continuing Direction 2 implementation with critical CSS override issue
- **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: CSS styles not applying despite correct inline code
- **Root Cause**: Tailwind config was importing DM Sans font, overriding system font approach
- **Problem**: `tailwind.config.js` had `fontFamily: { sans: ['DM Sans', 'sans-serif'] }`
- **Evidence**: Compiled CSS showed `font-family:DM Sans,sans-serif` in HTML tag
- **User Report**: Browser inspector showed `font-size: 13px` with strikethrough on inline styles
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Updated Tailwind config to use system fonts only
- **New Config**: `fontFamily: { sans: ['system-ui', '-apple-system', 'BlinkMacSystemFont', 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto', 'Oxygen', 'Ubuntu', 'Cantarell', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', 'sans-serif'] }`
- **Build Process**: Rebuilt site to regenerate CSS without DM Sans
- **Verification**: Compiled CSS now shows proper system font stack
- **Deployment**: Committed and pushed fix to remote repository for Netlify auto-deployment
- **Result**: Should resolve CSS override issue where inline styles were being ignored
- **Performance Alignment**: Maintains CLAUDE.md performance standards with zero external font loading
- **Status**: Critical fix deployed, awaiting user QA confirmation on Netlify
- **Claude Instance**: Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) - continuing session
- **Context**: User provided detailed QA feedback comparing current implementation to original Direction 2 jam version
- **User Feedback Summary**: Implementation successful but several elements need refinement to match jam version quality
- **Specific Issues Identified**:
  - **Stats section**: Numbers feel larger, text underneath smaller than jam version - less "put together"
  - **Testimonial section**: Should be tighter, name not perfectly left-justified with quote like jam version
  - **Work section**: Jam had stronger opening sentence vs current "bloated headlines", missing placeholder images create disappointment
  - **Services section**: "Why Story-Driven..." question was stronger, text sizes should be larger like jam version  
  - **About section**: Should match jam version more closely, even if removing content - prefer just headlines
  - **Contact form**: Too subtle, needs more grey distinction between form parts and labels
  - **Navigation approach**: Don't want navbar - prefer floating elements like Direction 6, vertical along edges, persistent logo
- **Positive feedback**: Testimonials section actually better than jam version
- **Next action**: Systematic refinement to match jam version quality while preserving performance

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERNS - WHAT DOESN'T WORK

### Performance Killers
- **External fonts**: Even Google Fonts add 200-500ms delay
- **Unused dependencies**: Each package adds to bundle size
- **Unoptimized images**: Can kill Core Web Vitals scores
- **Inline styles**: Harder to maintain and can block rendering
- **External fonts in Tailwind config**: DM Sans or other web fonts in Tailwind config override system fonts and cause CSS specificity issues

### SEO Killers
- **Hardcoded meta tags**: Leads to inconsistency and maintenance hell
- **Missing structured data**: Reduces search engine understanding
- **Poor heading hierarchy**: Confuses search engines and users
- **Slow loading**: Directly impacts search rankings

### Development Killers
- **Scattered configuration**: Hard to maintain and update
- **Poor documentation**: Wastes time for future developers
- **Complex abstractions**: Harder to debug and maintain
- **Inconsistent patterns**: Creates confusion and bugs
- **Making up features**: Don't assume what user wants - ask and validate
- **Sea of text**: Too much text without visual breaks creates poor UX
- **Generic tech aesthetics**: Broad appeal approaches that lack premium positioning
- **Rave crew design**: Overly technical or youth-focused design that doesn't target mature clients
- **Centered formatting**: Overly centered layouts that lack editorial sophistication
- **Thick/heavy fonts**: Heavy typography that lacks the refined feel of premium brands
- **Broad accessibility**: Trying to appeal to everyone instead of focusing on premium positioning
